        <h1 id="computers">Computers</h1>
        <p class="header"> A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences
            ofarithmetic or
            logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
            known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a
            nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
            equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are
            linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

            <h2 id="portables">Portable</h2>
            <p>A portable computer is a computer designed to be easily moved from one place
                to another and included a
                display and keyboard together, with a single plug, much like later desktop computers called all-in-ones
                (AIO), that integrate the system's internal components into the same case as the display. The first
                commercially sold portable was the 50-pound (23 kg) IBM 5100, introduced 1975. The next major portables
                were Osborne's 24-pound (11 kg) CP/M-based Osborne 1 (1981) and Compaq's 28-pound (13 kg), advertised as
                100% IBM PC compatible Compaq Portable (1983). These luggable computers still required a continuous
                connection to an external power source; this limitation was later overcome by the laptop. Laptops
                were followed by lighter models, so that in the 2000s mobile devices and by 2007 smartphones
                made the term almost meaningless. The 2010s introduced wearable computers such as smartwatches.</p>

                <h3 id="laptops">Laptop</h3>
                <p>A laptop computer is designed for portability with "clamshell" design,
                    where the keyboard and
                    computer components are on one panel, with a hinged second panel containing a flat display screen.
                    Closing the laptop protects the screen and keyboard during transportation. Laptops generally have a
                    rechargeable battery, enhancing their portability. To save power, weight and space, laptop graphics
                    chips are in many cases integrated into the CPU or chipset and use system RAM, resulting in reduced
                    graphics performance when compared to desktop machines, that more typically have a graphics card
                    installed. For this reason, desktop computers are usually preferred over laptops for gaming
                    purposes.</p>

                <p>A tablet uses a touchscreen display, which can be controlled using
                    either a stylus pen or finger.
                    Some tablets may use a "hybrid" or "convertible" design, offering a keyboard that can either be
                    removed as an attachment, or a screen that can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard.
                    Some tablets may use desktop-PC operating system such as Windows or Linux, or may run an operating
                    system designed primarily for tablets. Many tablet computers have USB ports, to which a keyboard or
                    mouse can be connected</p>

            <h2>Stationary</h2>
            <p>A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a
                single location on or near a desk
                due to its size and power requirements. The most common configuration has a case that houses the power
                supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit,
                memory, bus, certain peripherals and other electronic components), disk storage (usually one or more
                hard disk drives, solid state drives, optical disc drives, and in early models a floppy disk drive); a
                keyboard and mouse for input; and a computer monitor, speakers, and, often, a printer for output. The
                case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a
                desk.</p>

                <h3 id="workstation">Workstation</h3>
                <p>A workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical,
                    mathematical, or scientific
                    applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to
                    a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. Workstations are used for tasks such as
                    computer-aided design, drafting and modeling, computation-intensive scientific and engineering
                    calculations, image processing, architectural modeling, and computer graphics for animation and
                    motion picture visual effects.</p>

                <h3 id="desktop">Desktop computer</h3>
                <p>Before the widespread use of PCs, a computer that could fit on a desk
                    was remarkably small, leading
                    to the "desktop" nomenclature. More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style of
                    computer case. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases
                    to small models which can be tucked behind or rest directly beneath (and support) LCD monitors.

                    While the term "desktop" often refers to a computer with a vertically aligned computer tower case,
                    these varieties often rest on the ground or underneath desks. Despite this seeming contradiction,
                    the term "desktop" does typically refer to these vertical tower cases as well as the horizontally
                    aligned models which are designed to literally rest on top of desks and are therefore more
                    appropriate to the "desktop" term, although both types qualify for this "desktop" label in most
                    practical situations aside from certain physical arrangement differences. Both styles of these
                    computer cases hold the systems hardware components such as the motherboard, processor chip and
                    other internal operating parts. Desktop computers have an external monitor with a display screen and
                    an external keyboard, which are plugged into ports on the back of the computer case. Desktop
                    computers are popular for home and business computing applications as they leave space on the desk
                    for multiple monitors.</p>
